## Greetings and Salutations ðŸ‘‹
I am a graduate student at GaTech studying Quantitative Finance (and hopefully Computational Sciences and Engineering). Much of my learning with respect to coding is taking place right now, so my portfolio is a little all over the place. For now, I toss whatever code that I have into these repositories as proof of my learning, rather than pushing fully fledged projects. Hopefully, those will come in the near future.

Given the philosophy of my GitHub profile, I ask for your patience with my orderliness. I am a clean freak, so I am more stressed by the absolute chaos in my repositories than you. Once I get more comfortable with this platform, programming, and projects, I will absolutey psuh more organized repos.

In the meantime, I suggest you take a look at the groupwork that I have done for some of my courses! I am especially proud of the work that I did using an SVM model. 
Here is the link to my DMSL group project repo:
