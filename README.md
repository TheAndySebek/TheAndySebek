## Greetings and Salutations ðŸ‘‹
I am a graduate student at GaTech. Much of my learning with respect to coding is taking place right now. I typically toss whatever code I have into these repositories as proof of learning or cool thoughts that I had, rather than for fully fledged projects. Hopefully, those will come in the near future.

In the meantime, I suggest you take a look at the groupwork that I have done for some of my courses! I am especially proud of the work that I did using an SVM model. 
Here are the links to group project repos:

Given the philosophy of my GitHub, I ask for your patience with my orderliness. I am a clean freak, so I am more stressed by the absolute chaos in my repositories than you. Once I get more comfortable with this platform, programming, and projects, I will absolutey psuh more organized repos.
